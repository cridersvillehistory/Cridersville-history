Cridersville Historical Society

Year Founded:
1987
Brief Origin Story:
The Cridersville Historical Society was established in 1987 when the Bowsher Family
donated the fully restored Daniel and Catherine Bowsher Log Home on East Main Street.
The society soon realized it needed more space to tell the many stories of Cridersville’s past.
In 1990, it purchased the former EUB Church on W. Sugar Street. Over the years, it has been
given many remarkable artifacts, photographs, and documents that tell the stories of
Cridersville’s history in our Timeline Gallery.
